### Showcase of a complete Data Analysis Solution
##### Problem Statement → Data Gathering → Data Wrangling → Data Visualisation → Conclusion

This **Data Wrangling Project** involves deciding about a problem of interest and going out into the **real world** to find data.

> Please note that the project instructions have been rigid, in a sense that the project could not be optimally carried out, e.g.: The instructions required to apply 2 different methods of data gathering, out of the following available methods:

-  API (Application Programming Interface)
- Webscraping with Requests, Beautifulsoup, etc.
- Direct Data or Database Download

> Now the first dataset was a **direct download**, but the data proofed incomplete and the identifier columns of the datasets did not match as they supposedly should have. This was unfortunate as the **advanced selenium | beautifulsoup webscrape** of the second dataset, resulted in very clean and complete data with an optimal timespan. The resulting steps of the project where carried out as a proof of concept.

> A continuance of this project should be a merger with a high quality first dataset, which should be gathered with the result in mind of achieving the highest quality data, a complete and clean dataset of the **NBA´s Injury List, in primary regards to Ankle Strains**. 


## Structure and features of this showcase

- **Research-backed Problem Statement:**  **Are low top shoes player less injury prown to ankle strains?** - Please refer to jupyter notebook for research references
- **Data Gathering :** Dataset 1 is a direct download from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loganlauton/nba-injury-stats-1951-2023/), dataset 2 is a web scrape with **Selenium** and **Beautifulsoup** from [kixstats.com](https://kixstats.com)
- **Data Wrangling** Modifying and cleaning the datasets according to tidiness and quality issues, with subsequent merging of the datasets
- **Data Visualisations** A short section that interprets the master dataset by visualizing features of interest. A preliminary conclusion is drawn, on the basis of the specific matplotlib visualisations
